## Foreign Key Relationships

The table has the following foreign key relationships:

- **dope_sessions(id)** - Links to parent DOPE session containing session-level metadata and configuration

## Purpose and Context

The `dope_measurements` table stores individual shot measurement data within DOPE (Data On Previous Engagement) sessions. Each record represents a single projectile fired during a shooting session, capturing:

- Ballistic performance (velocity, energy, power factor)
- Environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity)
- Targeting adjustments (elevation, windage, distance)
- Shot-specific metadata (bore condition, notes, timestamp)

Each measurement is linked to its parent DOPE session, which provides the context of rifle, cartridge, range, and overall session configuration.

## Key Features

1. **User Isolation**: The `user_id` field ensures data is properly isolated per user
2. **Metric-Only Storage**: All measurements are stored in metric units internally
3. **Flexible Data**: Most fields are nullable to accommodate varying data availability
4. **Shot Tracking**: Sequential shot numbering and timestamps for temporal analysis
5. **Environmental Context**: Captures conditions at the time of each shot for correlation analysis
6. **Parent Session Link**: All measurements are tied to a DOPE session for complete context
