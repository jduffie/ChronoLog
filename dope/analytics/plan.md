The analytics page should provide tabs for various
well know graphs and a single "build your own graph" tab.

The user would need to select following before graphs are rendered:
 * cartridge_type
 * rifle
 * one or more cartridges that was used for that rifle and cartridge_type

The well know graphs are:
 * show how muzzle velocity changes with temperature
 * show how muzzle velocity changes with barometric pressure
 * show how muzzle velocity changes with humidity 




The user can select various series for the X series
and then one or more series for the Y.

We want nice looking graphs.

The default graph when you enter the page is
to plot muzzle velocity as the weather changes.
