# DOPE View UI Issues 

# Session filters - ✅ RESOLVED
~~When I select one of the rows in the session table, the Filter section opens up as if I had selected the dropdown for it to appear.~~ - Fixed auto-opening issue by removing forced expander state


# Session table 
~~should not include a column for UUID~~
- UUID column removed from sessions table display
- bug - 'Chronograph: Linked' under Session Info should be: 'Chronograph name: [name of chronograph]' - the value is referenced via chronograph session/chronograph source
- Desired behavior for Session Details 
  - User can select one of these tabs: Session Info, Range, Rifle, Cartridge, Bullet, Weather, Shots
  - If Session Info, Range, Rifle, Cartridge, Bullet, Weather, then render the all details in the section below but readonly.  Use
     markdown sections for column headers where appropriate
  - If user selects Shot
    - render the shot table - read only
    - each row in the shot table should include a selection box. 
    - Only one row can be selected at a time
    - If user selects the row, then following section renders the values but all are editable
