# How to Use ChronoLog


Your goal is to create DOPE Sessions that merge existing data from your chronograph, rifle profile, and cartridge. Optionally, you
can include Kestrel weather data and GIS data from your firing position.

## Getting Started

Start by importing your Garmin Xero X1 session file.  This file can be exported from the Garmin ShotView App.  See 
[Exporting Sessions](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=PAkjM4MDQP1sTBF5nXrgI9)
